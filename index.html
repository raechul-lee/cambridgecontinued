                   He was the son of a dead man. His father, Lucius Caecilius Iucundus, had met his fiery demise at the hands of Mount Vesuvius. His mother was killed somewhere else in Pompeii like a mere commoner. His home, his city, his life was utterly destroyed. His name was  <span class="waviy">

              <p>Quintus Caecilius Iucundus escaped Pompeii by a stroke of luck. His numerous escapades in the Roman world blurred together, but he vaguely remembered traveling to Egypt, finding a long lost son, and intercepting a plot against some king. <em>Cogidubnus? No, Cogidubstep. Ah, yes. </em></p>

<p>In the present, Quintus is in a bit of a predicament. He is in an unfamiliar land, on what appears to be an island of rolling hills and snow-capped mountains along with lush greenery and a rugged coastline. How did he get here? Well, all he remembers is lying in his bed in Britain and suddenly seeing a bright flash before his eyes. When he got up, he was on this strange island. Quintus gets up and starts walking. <em>There must be people in this beautiful place,</em> he thinks. He sees a sign in his tongue. "Formosa," it reads. <em>Beautiful land? Hmm, makes sense.</em></p>
